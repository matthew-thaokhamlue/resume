          <h3>Project Overview</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Role:</strong> Technical Product Manager<br />
            <strong>Company:</strong> LabTwin GmbH (acquired by Labforward)<br />
            <strong>Duration:</strong> January 2023 - November 2024<br />
            <strong>Team Size:</strong> 8 members (6 engineers, 1 designer, 1
            customer support)
          </p>

          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            Scientific laboratories needed a hands-free solution for
            documentation and data entry during experiments. Traditional methods
            required researchers to stop their work, remove gloves, and manually
            input data, disrupting workflow and potentially compromising sterile
            environments.
          </p>

          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>
            Led the integration of advanced NLP and speech-to-text models
            specifically trained for scientific terminology and laboratory
            environments. The solution enabled researchers to document
            experiments, record measurements, and manage inventory through voice
            commands.
          </p>

          <h3>Key Achievements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>95% accuracy</strong> in scientific domain speech
              recognition
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>2 major integrations</strong> delivered: Revvity Signals
              inventory management and LabVantage LIMS
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>12 releases per year</strong> increased from 4 through
              improved delivery process
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
          <p>
            Python • Natural Language Processing • Speech-to-Text Models • API
            Integrations • Machine Learning • Laboratory Information Management
            Systems (LIMS)
          </p>

          <h3>Impact</h3>
          <p>
            The AI integration transformed how researchers interact with
            laboratory systems, enabling seamless voice-driven workflows that
            maintain sterile environments while improving data accuracy and
            research efficiency.

            specialized teams
          </p>

          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            Health industry companies struggled with fragmented data sources and
            complex integrations when building health applications. Each
            wearable device and health platform required separate integration
            efforts, creating significant development overhead.
          </p>

          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>
            Built a unified SDK that provided seamless access to multiple health
            data sources through a single API. The platform standardized data
            formats and handled the complexity of individual device integrations
            behind a clean, developer-friendly interface.
          </p>

          <h3>Key Achievements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1M+ users</strong> served across the platform</li>
            <li>
              <strong>100+ customers</strong> across insurance, digital health,
              and academic research
            </li>
            <li><strong>€1M ARR</strong> contributed to company growth</li>
            <li>
              <strong>10 major integrations</strong> including Oura Ring, Whoop,
              Omron Wellness, Samsung Health
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
          <p>
            SDK Development • RESTful APIs • Data Integration • Health Data
            Standards • Wearable Device APIs • Cloud Infrastructure • Data
            Analytics
          </p>

          <h3>Impact</h3>
          <p>
            The SDK became the foundation for numerous health applications,
            enabling insurance companies, digital health startups, and research
            institutions to build data-driven solutions without the complexity
            of managing multiple device integrations.

            <strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Python, Gemini, Claude, OpenAI
          </p>

          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            Repetitive manual tasks in product management workflows were eating
            up valuable time that could be spent on strategic work. Creating
            release notes, writing Jira tickets, and API testing required
            consistent formatting and attention to detail but offered little
            creative value.
          </p>

          <h3>Solutions Built</h3>
          <p>
            Developed a suite of Python-based automation tools that leverage
            LLMs and APIs to streamline common product management tasks, turning
            hours of manual work into minutes of automated execution.
          </p>

          <h3>Tools Developed</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Release Notes Generator:</strong> Python app with LLM
              integration that transforms raw feature lists into polished
              product release notes
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Jira Ticket Creator:</strong> Text-to-ticket tool that
              converts natural language input into properly formatted Jira bugs
              and user stories
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>API Tester:</strong> Developed a round-trip testing script
              for comprehensive API validation and regression testing
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Technical Approach</h3>
          <p>
            Python Development • LLM API Integration • REST API Testing •
            Natural Language Processing • Automated Documentation • CLI Tools
          </p>

          <h3>Impact</h3>
          <p>
            These self-built tools have significantly reduced time spent on
            routine tasks, allowing more focus on strategic product decisions
            and user experience improvements. Each tool addresses a real pain
            point in daily workflows.
