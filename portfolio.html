          <h3>Project Overview</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Role:</strong> Technical Product Manager<br />
            <strong>Company:</strong> LabTwin GmbH (acquired by Labforward)<br />
            <strong>Duration:</strong> January 2023 - November 2024<br />
          </p>

          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            Scientists using Revvity Signals Notebook needed a seamless way to
            manage laboratory inventory without interrupting their experimental
            workflows. Traditional inventory management required manual data
            entry, disrupting sterile environments and taking focus away from
            critical research tasks.
          </p>

          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>
            Extended the existing LabTwin voice assistant integration with
            Revvity Signals Notebook to include comprehensive inventory
            management capabilities. This unified solution enabled scientists to
            manage inventory alongside experimental data capture, all through
            voice commands.
          </p>

          </p>

          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            Health industry companies struggled with fragmented data sources and
            complex integrations when building health applications. Each
            wearable device and health platform required separate integration
            efforts, creating significant development overhead.
          </p>

          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>
            Built a unified SDK that provided seamless access to multiple health
            data sources through a single API. The platform standardized data
            formats and handled the complexity of individual device integrations
            behind a clean, developer-friendly interface.
          </p>

            <strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Python, Gemini, Claude, OpenAI
          </p>

          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            Repetitive manual tasks in product management workflows were eating
            up valuable time that could be spent on strategic work. Creating
            release notes, writing Jira tickets, and API testing required
            consistent formatting and attention to detail but offered little
            creative value.
          </p>

          <h3>Solutions Built</h3>
          <p>
            Developed a suite of Python-based automation tools that leverage
            LLMs and APIs to streamline common product management tasks, turning
            hours of manual work into minutes of automated execution.
          </p>

          <h3>Tools Developed</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Release Notes Generator:</strong> Python app with LLM
              integration that transforms raw feature lists into polished
              product release notes
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Jira Ticket Creator:</strong> Text-to-ticket tool that
              converts natural language input into properly formatted Jira bugs
              and user stories
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>API Tester:</strong> Developed a round-trip testing script
              for comprehensive API validation and regression testing
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Technical Approach</h3>
          <p>
            Python Development • LLM API Integration • REST API Testing •
            Natural Language Processing • Automated Documentation • CLI Tools
          </p>

          <h3>Impact</h3>
          <p>
            These self-built tools have significantly reduced time spent on
            routine tasks, allowing more focus on strategic product decisions
            and user experience improvements. Each tool addresses a real pain
            point in daily workflows.
