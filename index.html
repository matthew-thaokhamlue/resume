          <h3>Cooking</h3>
          <p>
            When I'm not building products or analyzing data, you'll find me in
            the kitchen experimenting with flavors and techniques. I have a deep
            passion for <strong>Thai cuisine</strong> - there's something
            magical about balancing sweet, sour, salty, and spicy elements that
            mirrors the complexity I love in product development.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cooking is a way to connect with others and share experiences. I
            believe some of the best conversations happen over a shared meals &
            drinks and spending quality time with other.
          </p>

          <h3>Why cooking matters?</h3>
          <p>Just like in product management, cooking requires:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Attention to Detail:</strong> Every ingredient and timing
              matters
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Iterative Improvement:</strong> Each dish is a chance to
              refine and perfect
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>User Experience:</strong> Creating something that brings
              joy to others
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cultural Understanding:</strong> Respecting traditions
              while innovating
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Food, and rightly cooked, has the incredible power to give good UX
            to people. Food can bring people together, break down barriers, and
            create lasting memories, that make them want to come back for more.

                "Matthew joined Thryve as the 7th employee. He has been pivotal
                in building our quality assurance team, our customer operations
                team and our product team. As a product owner, he has managed to
                scale a complex and unique IT service in a highly regulated and
                demanding field of health care from 1k end users to over 1
                million end users.
              </p>
              <p>
                Matthew has steered our agile development process as a scrum
                master. He worked closely with the c-level, front end team, back
                end team and quality assurance team to plan, execute and review
                sprints and releases. In this role, he showed exceptional
                dedication, hands-on attitude and a great technical
                understanding.
              </p>
              <p>
                Matthew massively contributed to Thryve's growth and
                professionalization. The whole team is grateful to have worked
                with him and sad to let him go. I am sure Matthew will continue
                to manage big IT projects and scale complex operations
                convincingly."

                I highly recommend Matthew, my former Technical Product Manager. I worked with him on a number of features, and his contributions were critical to getting them shipped.
              </p>
              <p>
                Matthew has a remarkable ability to take nebulous business requirements and translate them into a clear, actionable backlog for the engineering team. He's also an incredibly fast learner. He quickly got up to speed on our complex systems and made smart, informed decisions on what to prioritize to maximize impact with minimal overhead.
              </p>
              <p>
                On a personal level, he's great to work with. He was always available to unblock us, help us navigate dependencies, and make sure we had the context we needed to build things correctly the first time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Matthew is a top-tier TPM, and I'd work with him again in a heartbeat. He's a huge asset to any product or engineering team.

                I‚Äôve had the privilege of working closely with Matt as his manager and CPO, and watching his journey has been one of the most rewarding parts of my role. From the moment he joined the team, Matt stood out as a fast learner‚Äîsomeone who not only picks up complex concepts quickly but also asks the right questions to get to the heart of a problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                What I admire most is his genuine can-do attitude. No matter how ambiguous or challenging the situation, Matt dives in with curiosity and focus, turning ideas into tangible outcomes. I‚Äôve truly seen him grow‚Äîfrom confidently shaping roadmaps to leading cross-functional squads with empathy and clarity. His growth isn‚Äôt just in skills, but in the way he brings people together.
              </p>
              <p>
                Matt is a natural team player who listens, collaborates, and makes everyone around him better. He bridges gaps between engineering, design, and customer teams with ease, always keeping the bigger picture in mind while never losing sight of the details that matter.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you‚Äôre looking for someone who combines sharp product thinking with humility, grit, and genuine care for the team, Matt is that person. I feel lucky to have worked with him and can‚Äôt wait to see where his talents take him next.

                I worked with Matthew for more than 3 years in a
                cross-functional team where he was the Production Owner. I was
                extremely impressed with his analytical mind and his ability to
                dig deep and notice even the small details of a software
                feature. With his attitude of can-do and let's get thing done,
                as well as his ability to pick things up quickly, his
                contribution to the team was highly significant and valuable. It
                was always a pleasure to co-work with him, as he takes his
                responsibility very seriously while maintaining a pleasant,
                collaborative discussion. I could always count on him to
                complete his tasks with full efforts and excellent output, and
                his supportive nature towards our colleagues.
